Itâ€™s a very strong and never falls because of the demands that in 2016, reaches 88 million sales, 4.8 percent more than the previous 2015, these can be divided not just for the suppliers, but also for the auto-makers or the equipment manufacturer that, more or less, spans within 10 years.

Autolux is all about managing stocks and transactions of car equipment for car shops, all digitally. The process of manual management such as paper-based is no longer recommended. As the data grows bigger, it can create a complication of data searching and data sorting.
